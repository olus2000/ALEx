( This extension allows for better handling of files
  and directories. Adding the `filepath` ancillary
  stack allows words to set a relative path for other
  words to work from.

  # Glossary:

  filepath ( --> s ):
    An ancillary stack holding the relative path to
    be used by file handling words.
    
    This stack is protected.

  with-path ( $ --> $ ):
    Prepends the top value from the `filepath` stack
    to the string on top of the Quackery stack.

  sharefile, takefile, releasefile, replacefile,
  putfile:
    Changed the default behavior to prepend the given
    file name with the top value from the `file.path`
    stack.
  
  loadfile:
    Changed the default behavior to prepend the given
    file name with the top value from the `filepath`
    stack. This word now only checks for duplicate
    loads using the given file name. If you wish to
    load a file from another directory then put this
    directory on `filepath` first and only pass the
    file name to `loadfile`.                         )
