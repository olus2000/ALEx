( This module adds a builder that serves a similar purpose as `constant`
  but instead of resulting in an object that will put the calculated value
  on the stack it just results in the object, no matter if it's a stack,
  an operator or a number, without any additions.

  # Glossary:

  literal ( a b --> c d ):
    A builder that will take the element last added to `a`, `do` it and
    put the resulting object back to `a`. The object done should have
    a stack effect of ( --> x ).
                                                                           )
